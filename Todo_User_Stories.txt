User Stary 1:I want an easy to use ToDo App that allows me to enter 
              a todo statement, delete it if I need to, or mark it 
              as completed.

User Story 2: I want an application that will allow me to enter To-Do
              items, and then update and/or delete those items as needed.

User Story 3: I would like a To-Do Application that allows me to enter the
              To-Do statements and then change the color around the to red.
              Once I have completed the To-Do item, I want to mark it 
              as completed. If I choose to at anytime, I want to be able
              to delete the items no matter whether they are completed,
              or not.
